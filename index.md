I'm a first year PhD student at the [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk) where I'm supervised by [Alexey Pokrovskiy](https://alexeypokrovskiy.com).  Previously, I did a masters degree supervised by [Tibor Szabó](http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/szabo/) at [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html). Before that, I was an undergraduate at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu). 

I'm interested in extremal and probabilistic combinatorics.
