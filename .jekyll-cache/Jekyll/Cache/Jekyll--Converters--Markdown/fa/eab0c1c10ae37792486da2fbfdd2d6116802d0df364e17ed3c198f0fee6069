<p>I’m a second year PhD student at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk">University College London</a> where I’m supervised by <a href="https://alexeypokrovskiy.com">Alexey Pokrovskiy</a>.  Previously, I did a masters degree supervised by <a href="http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/szabo/">Tibor Szabó</a> at <a href="https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html">Freie Universität Berlin</a>. Before that, I was an undergraduate at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.</p>

<p>I’m interested in extremal and probabilistic combinatorics. See my <a href="/research">Research</a> page to see my papers. Below is a representative selection.

<br /> <br />This paper gives a sufficient condition for the minimum degree threshold and the rainbow minimum degree threshold for the containment of a spanning structure to be asymptotically the same. The sufficient condition, roughly speaking, is the existence of an absorption-based proof for the non-rainbow threshold. Such absorption-based proofs are ubiquitous in the literature, hence this theorem has many applications.</p>

<br /><br /> Ramsey’s theorem states that any red-blue-edge-colouring of a complete graph contains a large complete subgraph which is either entirely red or entirely blue. If we add in the assumption that each colour class in the host graph is <em>well-represented</em>, can we strengthen Ramsey’s theorem to find a richer class of unavoidable patterns? This line of study was initiated by Bollobás, and has a rich history. This paper investigates the case of colourings which are <em>locally-well-represented</em>, in the sense that each vertex has many red and blue neighbours. <br /><br /></li>
